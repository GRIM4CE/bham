# Bham Monorepo

This is my personal monorepo for developing and deploying my portfolio site. The monorepo is constructed using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/). The tech stack is primarily [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The code is deployed with AWS Amplify, images are hosted on S3 and servered through [Imgix](https://imgix.com/).
